It is no valid objection that science as yet throws no light on the far higher problem of the essence or origin of life. Who can explain what is the essence of attraction of gravity? No one now objects to following out the results consequent on this unknown element of attraction; notwithstanding that Leibnitz formerly accused Newton of introducing \"occult qualities & miracles into philosophy\". - Charles Darwin.", "type": "p"}], "tags": ["Evolution", "Charles Darwin"]}

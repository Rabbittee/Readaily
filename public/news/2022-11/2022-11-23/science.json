Countries like the UK have traditionally been one of the biggest backers of telecoms projects (\u20ac2.4bn), given its manufacturing strength in big satellites. And many want to help build Esa's Earth observation (\u20ac3.0bn) spacecraft; likewise, participate in its human and robotic exploration missions (\u20ac2.9bn).

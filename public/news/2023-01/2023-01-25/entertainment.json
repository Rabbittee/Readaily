I'm not entirely sure how this happened.\"", "type": "p"}, {"text": "Well, we have a bit of an idea - and it involves Gwyneth Paltrow, Edward Norton, Courteney Cox, Susan Sarandon, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Aniston, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo, Sarah Paulson and Amy Adams.

But the copy-and-paste tweets and Instagram posts were driven by an apparently genuine admiration.", "type": "p"}, {"text": "The efforts to get the film on to the Academy's radar were ultimately successful, but it's hard to overstate how unusual Riseborough's campaign has been. ", "type": "p"}, {"text": "To Leslie reportedly only made $27,000 (\u00a321,800) at the box office when it first opened. (Having said that, it did make at least an extra \u00a34.49 last week when this reporter paid to rent it on a well-known streaming service.)", "type": "p"}, {"text": "The film premiered at South by Southwest last March. Unlike Toronto, Venice or Cannes, SXSW is not one of the film festivals considered a key part of the awards race and the film went largely unnoticed.", "type": "p"}, {"text": "\"After SXSW there was a quiet lull,\" Riseborough recalled. \"And then slowly, as the film had a few screenings elsewhere - including at Raindance, which was a big deal because we hadn't had a release in the UK - we found people were starting to talk about it.", "type": "p"}, {"text": "\"And people were asking us, 'Why can I not go and see it? Where can I see it?' After a while, we were able to point them to iTunes and Amazon, but it didn't happen right away.\"", "type": "p"}, {"text": "Nonetheless, a nomination seemed like a long shot. \"It was so hard to believe it might ever happen because we really hadn't been in the running for anything else,\" Riseborough commented.", "type": "p"}, {"text": "Crucially, the team behind the film uploaded it to the Academy's viewing portal, which meant voters could access it more easily. Meanwhile, the nomination Riseborough netted at the Independent Spirit Awards, which recognise small indie films, certainly didn't hurt.", "type": "p"}, {"text": "However, some expressed scepticism that the campaign was anything other than contrived.", "type": "p"}, {"text": "\"There are people saying this is such a beautiful, organic movement, and I've got to tell you, this is not organic,\" said Vanity Fair's Rebecca Ford. \"[Riseborough] has a very well-connected manager, she is well-respected by actors, and they just took this moment to launch this campaign, and it is a campaign.\"", "type": "p"}, {"text": "Riseborough's nomination is somewhat humbling for the many awards watchers who usually pride themselves on predicting which way things will go, based on the countless films they've watched and their sense of momentum on the ground at industry events.", "type": "p"}, {"text": "As Erik Anderson of Awards Watch tweeted, only half-jokingly: \"We are going to talk about the Andrea Riseborough campaign for DECADES to come.\"", "type": "p"}, {"text": "We'll certainly be talking about it until the Oscars ceremony on 12 March.
